DareBox _(dárɛ box)_ is a pre provisioned LAMP vagrant box in the vein of [scotchbox](scotchbox.io), but up to date.

# How to use

The vagrant base box is uploaded on vagrant cloud's box repository. You can see it [here](https://app.vagrantup.com/zwrawr/boxes/DareBox). To use it you just need to add it into your 'VagrantFile'.

```ruby
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
	config.vm.box = "zwrawr/DareBox"
	config.vm.box_version = "0.0.10"
end
```

# How to develop
## Prerequisite
 - Bash
 - System set up for vitualisation
 - Virtual Box
 - Vagrant

## Cloning the Repo
1. Clone this repo from github. 
2. Run `./darebox.sh build`, this will take a while (10 mins)
3. In your project's Vagrantfile add `/path/to/cloned/repo/output-darebox/package.box` as your source box.  
4. You need to add a file called `vars.pkvars.hcl` and add the following to get packer to run fully.
   ```
   apikey = "#######################################################"
   ```
## Tips

* If you have a built box (`0.0.0-package.box`) in build directory `output-darebox` then you can cd into `test` and launch the test VM. You can then `vagrant ssh` and poke around the VM to check stuff.

## Building and Testing

```
./darebox.sh <command>
	- build: Runs packer build generating a provisioned vagrant box
	- test: Runs our custom shell script to see if everything installed correctly
	- all: Runs build then test
	- clean: Removes build and test artifacts after shuting vms down
	- upload: Uploads the box to vagrant
	- size: Reports the size of the packaged Box
	- config: Reports the current config
	- help: Print this info
```

## Layout

* **`scripts/`** Scripts used to provision the vm and are called by vagrant based on there inclusion in `Vagrantfile`. These are the most important part.
  * **`motd/`** Files defining the custom message of the day and are copied by the `motd.sh` script.
* **`test/`** Test vagrant setup. Nothing in here contributes to building or configuring darebox.
  * **`test.sh`** Checks that the programs we want are installed.
  * **`versions.csv`** List of program versions generated by the `test.sh` script.
* **`output/`** Build box end up in here.
* **`darebox.sh`** Simple build and test runner.
* **`Vagrantfile`** The base vagrant config that the box will be based upon
